# The 450-question curriculum

This expansion adds 250 distinct runnable lessons to the previous 200, including 195 new beginner lessons. The published catalog contains 450 lessons (205 beginner) and one retrieval project checkpoint, with 4,760 public cases (2,516 new). The three full paths contain 159 / 129 / 162 mathematics/ML, deep-learning, and engineering lessons respectively.

Beginner means approachable work with real arrays, records, measurements, model inputs, and training decisions. The exercises assume basic Python. They do not count print exercises, renamed framework ports, or number-swapped variants as new objectives. Each addition has three concrete examples, progressive hints, an explanation, a scaffolded incomplete starter, an inspectable reference, and public checks.

## Finding a starting point

The beginner route at `/paths/start-here/` offers 18 selected starting points across records, measurements, and small neural networks. The library at `/beginner/` opens with the beginner filter selected. Both use the same lessons and local progress as the full paths; these views do not increase the lesson count. Links from the learning home, paths, and library make them discoverable.

## Authorship and review

The 250 additions contain original implementations, teaching prose, and fixtures. Packages identify original authorship and, where included, conceptual reading links. Reading links are not claims that code or exercise text was imported. Existing licensed adaptations retain their notices. The [complete inventory](../content/curriculum-450-inventory.json) records every new objective, level, prerequisite, and evaluator count.

Independent suites cover numerical identities, analytical or exhaustive oracles, data preservation, parsing boundaries, state transitions, and model-operation properties. Cross-batch checks align the three samples with the worked examples and reject fixed example answers on valid inputs. Exact executed release checks are recorded in [verification](verification.md).

The long-term target remains 2,000 learning activities. This milestone does not add account synchronization or production hosting.
