# Free resources and a faster curriculum workflow

The 23 October [exercise-platform follow-up](platform-pilot.md) adds TensorTonic,
Deep-ML, Pyre-Code and HappyTorch to the registry, bringing it to 25 resources.
Six Pyre-Code activities are adapted with MIT notices and original tests. That
follow-up records which platforms permit our intended reuse and which stay external.

Checked 22 October 2026. The first survey covers 21 sources: 18 GitHub
repositories plus Google ML Crash Course, MIT OpenCourseWare, and a verified UCI
dataset. Repository metadata, license files, and selected official course pages
were inspected. This is a useful starting set, not an exhaustive survey of the
internet or a claim that all upstream exercises have been reviewed or executed.

The machine-readable [source registry](../content/sources.json) records URLs,
Git revisions where available, license evidence, topics, runtime fit, and a reuse
decision for each source. No third-party lessons or datasets were imported
during that initial survey; the registry does not increase the published problem count.
The [23 October batch](curriculum-batch-03.md) uses these findings for 30 new
activities, including one credited D2L code adaptation with its original notice.

License evidence and immutable repository links are in the registry. In
particular, [D2L's sample-code license](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/blob/master/LICENSE-SAMPLECODE)
differs from its prose license; a repository's single GitHub license badge can
miss that distinction.

The [fastbook README](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook#readme),
[MIT OCW terms](https://ocw.mit.edu/pages/privacy-and-terms-of-use/), and
[Google site policies](https://developers.google.com/terms/site-policies)
explain the important differences. Free access, open reuse, and free execution
are separate questions. Images, datasets, model weights, and external services
do not inherit a course repository's license automatically.

## How this changes production

Work in topic batches of roughly 25–50 distinct objectives. This is a batching
policy, not a promised delivery rate. Start with NumPy/data preparation, then
probability/evaluation, then autograd and tokenization. Reuse the established
reading/editor/feedback interface; content-only batches do not need a redesign.

For each candidate, record its source revision and exact section, the learning
objective, misconception to expose, required runtime, and attribution obligations.
Turn it into an activity: predict a result, repair a defect, compare alternatives,
or build a component used by a project. Do not count translations, renamed
variables, or changed numbers as distinct problems.

Use the existing six-file package contract for all activities. Preserve upstream
license notices in adapted files, record modifications, and add an attribution
entry. The current schema only labels our original prose/code licenses; before
importing differently licensed material, extend provenance to record the actual
per-file upstream terms rather than silently relabeling it.

During authoring, run the fast batch check:

```sh
pnpm content:check m05 m06 m07 d05 d06 d07 e05 e06 e07
```

It validates the complete metadata/prerequisite graph, then executes selected
references, incomplete starters, trivial wrong answers, and sample/test counts.
It also flags identical task wording after numerical substitutions. That flag
is only a review aid, not semantic deduplication. Omit IDs to check all packages.
Unknown IDs fail rather than silently testing nothing.

This command does not build the frontend or reinstall runtime assets. Use it
after a content edit; run the independent numerical/misconception tests as the
batch develops. `pnpm check` remains the full release gate, followed by browser
CI covering every published reference in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Native
Python tests now run once in `pnpm check`, instead of twice. Manual UI review is
for changed components and new interaction formats; editorial review still
assesses every new objective, explanation, and test contract.

Large GPU/API notebooks should become explicitly linked external projects until
we implement an appropriate execution path. This keeps the free core usable and
avoids presenting incompatible notebooks as browser-runnable lessons.
