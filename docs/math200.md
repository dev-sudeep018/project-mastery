# Foundation expansion: M20–M59

This batch adds 40 original, executable NumPy lessons. Each package includes three worked examples, progressive hints, a reference, an unfinished starter, an explanation, and 10–11 public cases. The batch has 406 public cases and 23 independent numerical/property test methods in `tests/python/test_math200.py`.

The packages are original Project Mastery work: prose under CC-BY-SA-4.0 and code under Apache-2.0. No platform exercise text, reference code, or tests were imported. Primary documentation checked for conceptual conventions is linked below and in the corresponding packages.

## Scope and numerical review

These activities teach distinct operations, with explicit conventions where several mathematically valid choices exist. The mixture lesson performs both soft assignment and parameter fitting. The Dirichlet lesson scores a changing predictive sequence. Density neighborhoods are explicitly a stage of clustering, not an implementation of full DBSCAN.

Independent checks cover reconstruction and orthogonality identities, finite-difference gradients, binomial normalization, posterior composition, EM likelihood improvement, exhaustive isotonic block partitions, scalar distance/statistic oracles, and transport invariances. Public regression fixtures cover subnormal probability support, tiny joint mass, finite-output limits in inverse/solve routines, representable split thresholds, and tiny nonzero neighborhood distances.

Native verification passed for all 40 references, starter rejection, sample alignment, trivial wrong-answer rejection, all 406 public cases, and all 23 independent methods. Browser execution is part of the parent catalog integration gate.
